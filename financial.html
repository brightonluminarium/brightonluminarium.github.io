         <h1>Financial Considerations</h1>
      

<p>We expect the construction and development of the Brighton Luminarium to be covered by grants and charitable donations.  As an example, the 120 seater planetarium at the Royal Observatory Greenwich cost £3M to construct in 2006 (building and full internal fitting) and was part of a wider £15M redevelopment of the site.  All funding was raised through charitable grants from various educational Foundation.  A number of potential funding sources have been identified by the Brighton Luminarium team.</p>
      

<p><b>The cost of construction and fitting-out the Brighton Luminarium</b> will be approximately £12M - details of how this approximate costing has been reached are as follows. We begin by assuming a similar footprint to that of the main building of the Observatory Science Centre in Herstmonceux.  We plan for a 70m x 10m exhibition space, with a second-floor for classrooms of half that area, and a 12m diameter planetarium.  An additional 22m x 16m area for a shop and café is also presumed.  The approximate cost of the building has been calculated using the <a href="https://costmodelling.com/building-costs">Cost Modelling website</a>, which presents estimates for a wide variety of building uses, including museums and planetaria (£4,200/m<sup>2</sup>), secondary school classrooms (£2,200/m<sup>2</sup>), cafés (£2,700/m<sup>2</sup>) and shops (£2,000/m<sup>2</sup>).  The cost of fitting out these spaces have originated from a wide variety of sources (for <a href="https://www.turnerandtownsend.com/en/perspectives/culture-shift-the-changing-costs-of-exhibition-spaces/">museums</a>, <a href="https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2019-01/170822atisn11410doc09.pdf">classrooms</a>, <a href="https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/shop-fitting-cost/">shops</a> and <a href="https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/coffee-shop-fit-out-cost/">cafés</a>).  Based on other planetarium refurbishments and installations around the UK (e.g. the Winchester Science Centre upgrade cost £360k), we expect fitting out of the planetarium to cost an additional £0.5M.</p>
      
      <p><b>The operating costs for a science and technology discovery centre</b> in Brighton can be estimated by looking at the costs involved in other, similar sized centres across the UK.  Such data is publicly available on the Government’s Companies House website. As with museums and science centres across the UK, the primary source of income would be via an admission fee for visitors.  Additional income streams for science centres include cafés and shops, parking fees, charitable grants and donations, corporate sponsorship and venue hire (including conferences, weddings, parties, functions, filming, etc).</p>
