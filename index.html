       <h2 style="align: center;">A proposal for a science and discovery centre in Brighton.</h2>
   
<p>Our vision is for a science & technology discovery centre, called the Brighton Luminarium, to be built at the Black Rock site on Brighton’s sea front, immediately west of the Brighton Marina.  The Brighton Luminarium will be a unique attraction that will showcase Brighton with innovative architecture, exhibits and interactives, and will create a memorable and exciting day out for tourists, local families, and school groups alike. </p>
   
   <p>The theme of the Brighton Luminarium is Light.</p>
   <p>The centre will tell the stories of local Victorian pioneer inventors (such as Magnus Volk, who introduced electric lighting to the Royal Pavilion in 1883), how the quantum nature of light creates the colours that we see all around us (and how that is used to develop the next generation of ultra-fast quantum computers in Brighton), and how astronomers study distant light to understand our place in the Universe.</p>

      <ul><li>The Brighton Luminarium would be a major tourist attraction, attracting over 300,000 visitors per year (see the <a href="popularity.html">popularity page</a>).  Science centres have a proven track record of being popular and commercially successful across the UK, and welcome over 20 million visitors each year, yet the nearest to Brighton is a 45-minute drive away.<br><br></li>
     <li>Brighton’s Palace Pier, 2km away from Black Rock, is the most popular UK attraction outside London, with almost 5 million visitors each year, and Volk’s Electric Railway, a popular heritage attraction with over 150,000 journeys each year, would act as an accessible link between the Luminarium, Palace Pier &amp; Aquarium.<br><br></li>
        <li>The Brighton Luminarium would support science teaching in schools and colleges, providing curriculum enriching activities in state-of-the-art classrooms for all ages.  These classrooms would be available for hire as a unique venue hire and conference facility outside of school hours.<br><br></li>
        <li>Showcase and promote Brighton’s scientific, digital & creative industries, and raise awareness of Brighton’s world-leading scientific research at its two universities (including Nobel Prize winning research), and the city’s forward-looking ethos.<br><br></li>
        <li>The addition of a new year-round tourist destination in Brighton will also help the city reach a critical number of attractions required to encourage the large number of day and weekend visitors to stay longer in Brighton, to the benefit of the wider local economy.<br><br></li>
      </ul>
   <p>For all these reasons, we are confident that the Brighton Luminarium will be a success.</p>
        <p>The proposing team are in the process of setting up a charity, Brighton Luminarium, to raise funds, develop, build and operate the centre.  Funding required for the completion of the project is expected to be £12M - full details are on the <a href="financial.html">financial considerations page</a>. </p>
   
  <br><br>
   
         <p>This website is currently under construction as of February, 2022, and we hope to have the initial version of the website ready soon.  Please bear with us in the meantime!</p>
      <br><br>
