        <h1>The Vision</h1>

<p>Our vision is for a science & technology discovery centre, called the Brighton Luminarium, to be built at the Black Rock site on Brighton’s sea front, immediately west of the Brighton Marina.  The Brighton Luminarium will be a unique attraction that will showcase Brighton with innovative architecture, exhibits and interactives, and will create a memorable and exciting day out for tourists, local families, and school groups alike.  The Luminarium will consist of three primary zones with the overarching theme being Light.  </p>
      <p>The Brighton Luminarium will consist of the following areas:</p>

      <dl style="margin-left: 25px;">
        <dd><b>The Pioneer Zone</b> will explore the achievements of Brighton’s engineering visionaries, including Magnus Volk  who introduced electric lighting to the Royal Pavilion in 1883 and who constructed the electric railway along Brighton's sea front that is still running today, 139 years later!  Many visitors would travel to the venue via Volk’s Electric Railway, and there is the possibility of an integrated train station within the Luminarium, that would allow visitors to disembark directly into the centre.
        
        </dd>
        <dd><b>The Astronomy Zone</b> will explore how astronomers study distant light to understand our place in the Universe.  It would include a planetarium to present visitors with the latest astronomical discoveries and stunning images of our Universe.  The planetarium dome will be in the shape of a buckyball, to acknowledge Sir Harry Kroto being awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1996 for the discovery of the carbon-60 molecule at the University of Sussex in Brighton.
        </dd>
        
        <dd><b>The Quantum Zone</b> will be the world's first quantum museum, where visitors will explore how the quantum nature of light creates the colours that we see all around us, and how our understanding of light is allowing the next generation of ultra-fast quantum computers to be developed in Brighton.  This Zone will contain a <b>Quantum arcade</b>, where modern arcade-style games will introduce quantum physics to visitors in a fun and engaging way.</dd>
        
        <dd><b>An outdoor play area</b> would allow children to play with large interactive activities.</dd>
        <dd><b>Classrooms</b> will allow school groups to attend syllabus-linked workshops and would be available for hire for corporate or community events outside of school hours.</dd>
        <dd><b>An exhibitions & performance space</b> will host a variety of temporary exhibitions and events (e.g. Brighton Fringe, etc), from photographic exhibitions to open-air theatre.</dd>
        <dd><b>A café offering sea views</b> with outdoor seating would become a destination in its own right, and the centre will include a shop selling relevant toys and gifts and toilet facilities (including a changing places facility).</dd>

          <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <p>The motivation for building the Brighton Luminarium at the Black Rock site are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        
<li>Science centres have a proven track record of being popular and commercially successful across the UK (see the tables on page 8 and 10), with visitors consisting of school groups and local, national and international tourists.</li>  
<li>Be a major tourist attraction, attracting over 300,000 visitors per year (as do other science centres across the country) with unique, inspiring architecture. Over 20 million people visit UK science centres each year, yet the nearest to Brighton is a 45-minute drive away. </li>
        <li>It will be a unique attraction to showcase Brighton, consisting of the first Quantum Museum in the world.  Innovative architecture, exhibits and interactives will create a memorable and exciting day out for tourists, families and school groups alike.</li>
<li>Based on visitor numbers at similar venues around the UK (see table on page 8), we would expect at least 300,000 visitors to the Brighton Luminarium per annum.</li>
<li>Brighton’s Palace Pier, 2km away from Black Rock, is the most popular UK attraction outside London, with almost 5 million visitors each year.</li>
<li>Volk’s Electric Railway, a popular heritage attraction with over 150,000 journeys each year, would act as an accessible link between the Luminarium, Palace Pier & Aquarium.</li>
<li>The Brighton Luminarium would benefit local school children, especially those in the socio-economically deprived coastal communities, by supporting science teaching in schools and colleges, providing curriculum enriching activities in state-of-the-art classrooms for all ages. Novel demonstrations and activities using specialist equipment that is rarely available in schools (such as expensive thermal cameras) will help inspire the next generation to study science and technology subjects.</li>
<li>Provide a unique venue hire and conference facility, with the classrooms being available for hire as event venues outside of school hours.</li>
<li>Showcase and promote Brighton’s scientific, digital & creative industries, and raise awareness of Brighton’s world-leading scientific research at its two universities (including Nobel Prize winning research), and the city’s forward-looking ethos.</li>
        <li>Regenerate the Black Rock area.</li>
      </ul>
<p>The unique location at Black Rock will attract visitors from other nearby attractions, such as Brighton’s Palace Pier just 2km away (the 5th most visited attraction in the UK, with 4.9M visitors in 2019) and the Volk’s Electric Railway (with over 150,000 journeys per year).  The addition of a new year-round tourist destination in Brighton will also help the city reach a critical number of attractions required to encourage the large number of day and weekend visitors to stay longer in Brighton, thus benefitting the wider local economy.</p>
