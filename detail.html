<h2>In Detail</h2>
     
      
<p>The vision is for a science &amp; technology discovery centre to be built in Brighton at the Black Rock sea-front site by the marina, called the <b>Brighton Luminarium</b>.	It will be a unique attraction that will showcase Brighton, and the Luminarium will include the world’s first Quantum Museum.  Innovative architecture, exhibits and interactives, will create a memorable and exciting day out for tourists, families and school groups alike.</p>

   <p><br><b>The theme of the Brighton Luminarium is Light.</b>  The centre will tell the stories of local Victorian pioneer inventors (such as Magnus Volk who introduced electric lighting to the Royal Pavilion in 1883, and others who developed cinematic projection), how the quantum nature of light creates the colours that we see every day (and how that is being used to develop the next generation of ultra-fast quantum computers in Brighton), and how astronomers study distant light to understand our place in the Universe.</p>
      
      
<p>The centre will contain a range of hands-on exhibits for visitors to interact with, developed by experts from the Volk’s Electric Railway Association, academics at the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Sussex (which has a well-established outreach program run by members of the Brighton Luminarium team), and constructed by Science Projects Ltd, a non-profit organisation whose interactive award-winning exhibits are in science centres around the world. </p>

      <p><br><b>The Pioneer zone</b> will be the first stage in the journey of discovery, exploring how the achievements and legacy of the Victorian inventors of Brighton and Hove have helped change our world along the theme of light.</p>
<p>Arguably the most famous is Magnus Volk (1851-1937), whose railway still operates to this day along Brighton’s sea front to the west of the Black Rock site.  Having opened in 1883, it is the oldest working electric railway in the world.  The railway would serve to link the Brighton Luminarium at Black Rock with the popular attractions of the Aquarium and Palace Pier, and there is the possibility of having an end-of-the-line station within the Brighton Luminarium itself, allowing visitors to disembark directly into the centre.</p>
<p>
Inside the Pioneer Zone, visitors will marvel at the works of local Victorian inventors, with exhibits including telephones, X-ray machines, railways, fire alarms, electric cars, photography, colour film and projection, and many others.  An array of clocks made by local clockmakers will show times in different parts of the world, while simulators will allow children to drive a Volk’s railway train, use early telephones, fire alarms and early projectors.

   </div>
         
      <p><br><b>The Astronomy zone</b> will be dominated by a large planetarium surrounded by exhibition space.  Planetaria are unique and popular cinema-like domes onto which views of the stars and planets are projected, allowing visitors to be taken on immersive journeys. Planetaria are usually the most profitable part of any science centre.  While flying through space to explore our universe remains the most popular topic, the flexibility of modern digital projectors allows a vast range of subjects to be explored, such as the microscopic world of human cells or even visualising dinosaurs!  These domes are often called “digital theatres” to reflect on how artists worldwide are using planetarium domes as a novel digital canvas.  The contents of the Astronomy zone will be developed by education experts at both the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Sussex and the Observatory Science Centre (site of the former Royal Greenwich Observatory) in nearby Herstmonceux, and a display of historical astronomical instruments loaned from the OSC will ensure a seamless connection from the Pioneer Zone.</p>
<p>The planetarium will be constructed in the shape of a carbon-60 molecule, to recognise the discovery of this important football-shaped molecule at the University of Sussex in 1985 by Sir Harry Kroto, another local pioneer, who received the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.  Developing novel applications for carbon-60 is an active area of research worldwide.</p>

      <p><br><b>The Quantum zone</b> is motivated by the world-leading research being carried out in quantum physics at the University of Sussex, where scientists are paving the way for the next generation of ultra-fast quantum computers and are developing a range of quantum sensors with health and security applications.  This zone will explore the potential of this futuristic technology, showcasing the latest innovations and containing the Quantum Arcade, where modern arcade-style games will be used to explain scientific concepts about quantum physics in a fun and engaging way.  Appreciating that light exists beyond what is visible to the human eye is part of the GCSE school syllabus, and interactive exhibits (such as thermal cameras) will allow children to explore such usually invisible light.</p>

      <p><br><b>Stories of significant people</b> will be told throughout these key zones, to engage with visitors and inspire the next generation.  Not only will visitors learn about the Victorian pioneers and scientists of the past, but through a variety of public events, they will also get the opportunity to meet the astronomers and quantum physicists of the present, who are making new discoveries here in Brighton.  Stories will be told of scientists and inventors from a diverse range of genders, ethnicities, ages, disabilities and backgrounds, providing role models to all visitors, no matter what their background. </p>
      <p><br><b>Classrooms for school visits</b> will be included in the centre, as school and other educational groups from Brighton and beyond will make up a significant number of visitors.  A programme of events will be developed and delivered to schools which will be closely linked to their school syllabus.  Out of school hours (evenings, weekends, and school holidays), the classrooms will be used for adult evening courses, as indoor public performance spaces, or hired out for corporate or community functions.
</p>
      <p><br><b>An outdoor children’s play area</b> consisting of large, physical, hands-on activities, will enable children to explore scientific themes through play, as does the play area at the Observatory Science Centre.  Such play areas also encourage repeat visits.</p>
      <p><br><b>Additional exhibition & performance spaces</b> will also form part of the Brighton Luminarum, both outside and in.  These will enable a variety of visiting exhibitions, both arts and science, that can be updated on a regular basis (e.g. photographic exhibitions), which will encourage repeat visitors at minimal cost.
</p>
      <p><br><b>The centre will be fully accessible</b> to visitors who have a wide variety of additional needs, such as those with limited mobility, impaired sight or hearing, with a changing places toilet facility provided.  Dedicated quiet opening hours will provide a calm and relaxed environment for those (especially children) with sensory sensitivities.  
</p>
      <p><br><b>Landscaping around the centre</b> will be sensitive to the natural environment, with light pollution minimised.  The shop & café will be positioned so that they are readily accessible to all visitors to the area, especially those attending motor vehicle rallies, the marathon, London to Brighton cycle rides and other events regularly held on Madeira Drive.
